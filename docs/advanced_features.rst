Starting and Stopping Services in Linux for PHP
-----------------------------------------------

When manually starting and stopping services within a *Linux for PHP* container, one must use the standard *init* system
to do so.

To start the PHP-FPM server::

    $ /etc/init.d/php-fpm start

To stop the PHP-FPM server::

    $ /etc/init.d/php-fpm stop

To get the status of the PHP-FPM server::

    $ /etc/init.d/php-fpm status

These commands apply to all the main services that are included within all *Linux for PHP* images :

* Apache :           /etc/init.d/httpd [start/stop/status]
* nginx :            /etc/init.d/nginx [start/stop/status]
* MariaDB (MySQL) :  /etc/init.d/mysql [start/stop/status]
* PostgreSQL :       /etc/init.d/postgresql [start/stop/status]
* OpenLDAP :         /etc/init.d/slapd [start/stop/status]
* Exim Mail :        /etc/init.d/exim [start/stop/status]
* MongoDB :          /etc/init.d/mongod [start/stop/status]
* OpenSSH :          /etc/init.d/sshd [start/stop/status]

.. note:: All configuration files can be found within the ``/etc`` directory.

.. index:: Commands - lfphp

.. _lfphp-services:

Automating Services in Linux for PHP
------------------------------------

When using a *Linux for PHP* container in detached mode, it is possible to automate services using the ``lfphp`` command.
If you wish to start a container with only the *MariaDB (MySQL)* server running, you would enter the following command
when invoking the container::

    $ docker run -dit asclinux/linuxforphp-8.2-ultimate:7.4-nts bash -c "lfphp --mysql"

The available services are :

* Apache (``--apache``)
* Exim Mail (``--exim``)
* OpenLDAP (``--ldap``)
* MariaDB/MySQL (``--mysql``)
* nginx (``--nginx``)
* PostgreSQL (``--pgsql``)
* PHP FPM (``--phpfpm``)

.. note:: These optional switches can be combined and that the default behavior of the ``lfphp`` command is to start all services when no options are given.

.. note:: It is possible to get up to date help in using this command by entering the command ``lfphp --help`` or ``lfphp -h``.

.. index:: Packages - installation

.. index:: Commands - lfphp-get

.. _lfphp-get:

Package Installation Using the ``lfphp-get`` Command
----------------------------------------------------

Any *Linux for PHP* container makes it possible to install optional services from within the container by using the
``lfphp-get`` command. To install an additional service, simply enter the following command on the container's CLI::

    $ lfphp-get [options] name_of_service_to_install

.. note:: The ``lfphp-get`` command allows to compile some packages from source, by adding the ``--compile`` option at the end of the command.

To get a complete and up to date list of available services, please use the ``--list`` option::

    $ lfphp-get --list

.. note:: For now, *Linux for PHP* does NOT offer an easy way to automate optional services. These must be configured manually by creating and symlinking the appropriate runit scripts (``/services/[name_of_service]`` => ``/etc/sv/[name_of_service]``).

.. note:: It is possible to get up to date help in using this command by entering the command ``lfphp-get --help`` or ``lfphp-get -h``.
